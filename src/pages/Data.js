Recently, I took the next big step by enrolling in Northeastern University's Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering program at Boston. Apart from all that time I have been spending on artificial brains, you can find me talking about football (the one the call soccer in the US (⚆_⚆) ), going on hikes or trying my hand in cooking.",
